Hello there! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm Victor Wilson and I enjoy solving problems with software. This is my effort to solve a problem of my own by creating a solution that allows me to write and manage blog posts on my soon-to-be-created website. Thought to get started on the blog editor first. ðŸ˜‰

I've deployed the project on the Internet so you can review the documentation [here](https://blogify-production-1a01.up.railway.app/docs) (and also [redoc-style](https://blogify-production-1a01.up.railway.app/redoc)) as well as test the endpoints that do not require authentication.

# So, Blogify?

That's right. Blogify is an API backend blog editor app to manage my blog posts on my soon-to-be-created website. Backend means there is no frontend here. A frontend will be hosted on a different repository.

As I noted on the [Blogify Wiki](https://github.com/dsvwilson/blogify/wiki) homepage (where I share my thoughts on this project as I progress), I really like to write and share ideas. Though I am a WordPress expert and I could use that solution for a blog, I prefer in this case to re-invent the wheel for myself, which is _sometimes_ a good thing. It can be a good thing because it provides a valuable learning experience. And for embarking on this project, I hope to acquire a bunch of skills along the way as well as make something lightweight yet full of the functionality I choose.

# Purpose of the project

So this README introduces the project at a high level. It is not a tool that can be used to make blogs i.e., it isn't designed for you to use as your blog solution just as WordPress for example is. At least for now, it isn't. But I'd like to share the code and my thoughts publicly. There is a [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/Uxg5NguC/blogify-tracker) with interesting features coming up, my favourite being the [Post Audio with ElevenLabs](https://trello.com/c/ML9qEzjg/10-post-audio-with-elevenlabs) and the [SEO Analyser](https://trello.com/c/JQv9HMVY/8-seo-analyser). I do intend to continue to build on what I've started and I currently have a path in view.

As of writing, this project is fairly new. But active development is ongoing and I will keep regularly updating this README as well as providing insights into my work on the [Wiki](https://github.com/dsvwilson/blogify/wiki). You're welcome to check that out and chime in via the [Issues](https://github.com/dsvwilson/blogify/issues) section.
